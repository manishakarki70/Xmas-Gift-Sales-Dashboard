# Xmas-Gift-Sales-Dashboard

◆ **About the project:**

Christmas is an important sales period globally, and optimizing for the holiday rush can be difficult. This project intends to analyze Christmas sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior.

◆ **Dataset:**

The dataset includes anonymized Christmas sales data across product categories, customer demographics, and marketing campaigns. It also includes financial metrics (Budget, Sales, profit), Quantity, Units, etc.

◆ **Data Transformation:**

All transformations were performed within Power BI:

  ● A Calendar Table was added to enhance the time-related analysis.

  ● Data Grouping: To gain a better understanding of the data, I organized it by Christmas Seasons rather than by calendar years. For instance, November 2018, December 2018, and January 2019 are grouped as Xmas 2018/2019. This approach considers these three months as one season for both retailers and shoppers.

  ● Data Type Validation – All fields have validated data types. Since most data originates from EU countries, the currency used is the Euro.

◆ **Report:**

The report consists of two pages:

  ● **Customer Insights** – This page offers a comprehensive overview of how customer behavior influences sales. It includes an analysis of key metrics, such as total sales revenue, overall profit margins, and the quantity of products sold.

  ● **Price & Promotion Analysis** – This section is specifically designed to provide a quick evaluation of sales performance.

◆ **Key Insights:**

  ● According to the data, the dashboard provided the following insights:

  ● The Children segment (ages 1-11) stood out, contributing nearly 40% of total Christmas sales over the years.

  ● Toys and clothing took the lead as the top-selling product categories, contributing a significant 27% to total sales among the 17 categories.

  ● Sweden took the crown for the most Christmas sales over the four seasons, reaching 3.8 million Euros.

  ● Despite higher prices, children's products lead in sales quantity, with over 12 thousand units sold for each product over the past four Christmas seasons.

  ● Among products for adults, unit price variation did not significantly affect the quantity sold (around 6-7 thousand units per product).

  ● December was the busiest month for Christmas gift shopping, with sales doubling compared to November and January.

  ● In-store shopping dominated December, accounting for 77% of sales, making it an excellent time for in-store promotions.

  ● In-store shopping peaked on Monday, followed by Sunday. Sundays at 3 pm became the busiest time for Christmas markets.
